Black Sesame Macarons with Black Sesame Buttercream and Adzuki Beans
==========
+ Yield: Makes: 35 to 40 filled macarons
+ Time:

Ingredients
---------
Macaron shells

+ 90 grams egg whites (about 3) preferably aged 3-5 days in the fridge
+ pinch of kosher salt
+ 30 grams granulated sugar
+ 185 grams powdered sugar
+ 60 grams almonds
+ 55 grams black sesame seeds, toasted
+ 1 teaspoons of vanilla powder

Black sesame buttercream

+ 1/2 cup sugar
+ 2 large egg whites
+ 1 1/2 sticks (6 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature
+ 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
+ 1/4 cup black sesame seeds powder
+ A pinch of Kosher salt

Directions
---------
Macaron shells

1. In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the egg whites and salt on high, gradually add the sugar until stiff peak forms.
2. Place the powdered sugar, almonds, sesame seeds, and vanilla powder in a food processor and process until the nuts and seeds are finely ground.
3. Add them to the meringue. Fold the mixtures carefully until you obtain a batter that falls back on itself after counting to 10. The whole process takes about 40 to 50 strokes.
4. Test a small amount on a plate; if the tops flatten on its own after counting to 10, the batter is ready. If there is a small beak, give the batter a couple more folds.
Fill a pastry bag fitted with a large plain tip with the batter and pipe small rounds (1 inch to 1.5 inches in diameter) onto parchment paper or silicone mats lined baking sheets.
5. Preheat the oven to 280F. Let the macarons sit out at room temperature for 30 minutes to an hour to harden their shells and bake for 18 to 22 minutes, depending on their size. Rotate baking pans once half way through baking. Cool completely on wire rack before removing macaron shells from baking sheets.

Black sesame buttercream

1. In the bowl of a stand mixer or a heat proof bowl, add the sugar and egg whites together. Whisk constantly over a saucepan of simmering water. Keep whisking the mixture over the heat, until it feels hot to the touch and foamy, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and place the bowl back to the stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat the meringue on medium high until it cools.
2. Switch to the paddle attachment and add the butter, one tablespoon at a time, beating until smooth. Once all the butter is in, add the sesame seed powder. Beat the buttercream until thick and very smooth, about 6-10 minutes.

Assemble

1. Fill sesame seed buttercream in a pastry bag fitted with a medium round tip. Then, pipe the buttercream on the outer rim of one macaron shell and dollop a small amount of adzuki bean in the middle. Then, top with another macaron shell, repeat until all shells are filled.

Tips
----------
1. Get a kitchen scale.  It’s important to follow the exact recipe down to the gram (or ounces.) Take the time to measure and weight out each ingredient.  You’ll be rewarded.  This is the digital kitchen scale that I’ve been using.  It’s not expensive at all and it’s one of my best friends in the kitchen.
2. Aged the egg whites.  I usually separate the egg whites (save those yolks for crème brûlée!) and leave the egg whites covered with plastic wrap in the fridge for 3-5 days before using.  The aging process dehydrates the egg whites, resulting in a tighter and more stabilize meringue.
3. Pay attention during Macaronage—mixing the dry ingredients into the meringues!  If the batter is over mixed, the macarons will turned out flat and cracked.  If the batter is not mixed enough, there will be a peak on top and the feet won’t form.  Just make sure to use a spatula to fold the ingredients together between 40 to 50 strokes.  Testing a small amount of batter on a plate before piping is a smart move.  If the peak falls back on its own in 10 seconds, you’re good to go.
4. After piping the macaron shells, let them sit out at room temperature for 30 minutes to and hour to harden the shells before baking.  That would prevent the tops from cracking.
5. Double stacking the baking sheets.  That would help the macaron shells bake up more evenly.  When using double baking sheets, the bottoms of the maracons do not heat up too quickly, resulting nicer and taller feet.
