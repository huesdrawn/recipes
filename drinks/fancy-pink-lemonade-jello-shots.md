Fancy Pink Lemonade Jello Shots
==========
+ Yield: 40 jello shots

Ingredients
---------
+ 10 lemons
+ one box watermelon (or any kind of pink color) jello
+ 1 cup vodka
+ 1 cup boiling water

Directions
---------
1. Prepare lemons by cutting them in halves and hollowing out the peel. This may sound easier than it is. The trick is to take a paring knife and score around the insides carefully to loosen the citrus. Then spoon it out saving the fruit. (If you have a juicer for every 1 cup of lemon juice add 6 cups of water and half a cup of sugar and 3 teaspoons of honey for an awesome lemonade).
2. Boil one cup of water and add it to jello mix in a large bowl, stirring until it dissolves.
3. Slowly add one cup of vodka and stir.
4. Pour mixture into a cup with a spout (for an even pour). I use a measuring cup. Line up limes on a cookie sheet so they are secure and upright. Pour in jello mixture. Refrigerated over night.
5. Carefully (gingerly) quarter the halves with a sharp knife.

Tips
----------
1. For a kid friendly non-alcoholic version just use cold water instead of vodka!
2. Buy "Jello" brand jello or the shots are way too strong.
3. Use oranges or lemons, but not limes (to bitter).
