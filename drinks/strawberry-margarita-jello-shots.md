Strawberry Margarita Jello Shots
==========
> Notes: will have leftover jello... increase # of strawberries

Ingredients
---------
+ 2 plastic containers of strawberries
+ 1 regular (small) box Strawberry Jell-O
+ 1 cup tequila
+ 1 cup water
+ Sugar and sliced lime for garnish

Directions
---------
1. Cut the bottoms of the strawberry flat to get them to stand upright. When you do so, make sure that you do not cut off so much that there is a hole at the bottom.
2. Use a paring knife or small spoon to hollow out the berries. Don't get too into emptying the strawberry, just do your best.
3. Boil one cup of hot water in a saucepan, then add in Jell-o powder and whisk until powder is completely dissolved, about 2 minutes. Set aside. Measure out 1 cup of  tequila and set aside.
4. Add cold tequila to hot Jell-o mixture and stir to combine.
5. Pour mix into strawberries and chill overnight. Pour some sugar on a plate and rim your strawberries with it. You don't need to wet the berry it will stick on its own. Garnish with cut lime triangles to finish. Keep really cold until serving.

Tips
----------
1. For a kid friendly non-alcoholic version just use cold water or lemonade instead of tequila!
2. Look for the biggest strawberries you can, they hold the most jello.
3. REALLY  be careful about cutting off the bottom of the strawberry. Just the littlest hole (even a teeny tiny one) will make your jello leak out of the berry.
4. Buy "Jello" brand jello or the shots are way too strong.
